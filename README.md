# Access Code 2.2 Final Project Proposal

**Project Name: SeekNYC**  
**Team Name: Seekers**  
**Team Members: Christella Dolmo, Justine Kay, Felicia Weathers**  

## The Problem

We all get stuck in the same old routine and repeat the same paths to similar destinations rather than discovering a new path.  

Most tourists only see a small percentage of what a place has to offer.

It's not easy to quantify how much of the city you've actually come to know.

In NYC, how can we motivate people to discover other locations around the city outside of where they live and work, and encourage tourists to step outside of Manhattan and visit more of the other 4 boroughs?

## The Solution

A real-life game that reveals how much of NYC you've actually explored and rewards you for uncovering more of the map.  

The app tracks your movement as you trek through the city and reveals an underlying map of NYC in full color and detail. It shows you what percentage of the 5 boroughs you've actually covered, and you earn badges for uncovering more ground and exploring areas off your beaten path. 

The map has a gray opaque overlay.  Everywhere the user has been is uncovered in full color and detail.

#### Baseline Features:
* User can acheive awards and obtain certain levels for visiting specific places, traveling new routes, and avoiding well-known tourist traps.
* User's map is saved in Parse.
* User's tracks appear different when they've taken the same route multiple times.
* User can share maps on twitter and facebook.
* User chooses when to turn tracking on and off.

#### Bonus Features
* User can track walking, biking and driving seperately
* User can view other user's maps in app
* User can drop markers, with photos and notes (Peek & Pop)
* User includes where they live in the sign up process to determine whether they experience the app as a visitor or resident. 
* User experience is slightly different depending on whether they are a visitor or resident.

With endless thanks to Orta Therox.
